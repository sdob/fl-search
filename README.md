# Fallen London Item Search

An unofficial browser extension for [Fallen London](http://fallenlondon.storynexus.com/)
that allows desktop users to search for items and qualities in their inventory
and scrapbook and mantelpiece dialogs.

This extension allows you to search by name for items in your inventory
and will hide categories where nothing matches, cutting through the clutter.
Here's an example of using the extension to find notes from a scientific
expedition.

It's also possible to search for a particular quality or item when
choosing something for your scrapbook or mantelpiece.
